                    It was an amazing 2-Days hands-on workshop on Robotics with the awesome benefits like, learning robotics on a live robot with 0% theory 100% Practical teaching, Making your own robot as we were providing personalised robotics kits to the students, perform interesting tasks on the robot and learning to code in arduino IDE. This workshop was an amazing success and students coded on their very first robot.

                        It was a complimentary training provided to all participants of Techinar Phase 1 and 2. This was a 1 month long training program, where students were given task on robotics based on the training provided to them to solve by themselves and support from our side. This program involved a total of 4 task to be solved by students. We maintained the interest and curiosity of the students while providing them with amazing tasks and received great responses from all our students.

                        It was the first ever webinar conducted by team InnoventX, for all the enthusiastic and brainy young minds. This 2-day Techinar was exclusively for the School-going students of 8th to 12th Grade. It was a whole lot of interactive and involving for the students to learn to the fullest. This Techinar session covered all the important concepts and basics of Robotics and ignited the fire in the students to advance themselves in this field.
